# SolarTrackerWithIRRemote

A solar tracker is a device that orients a payload toward the Sun. Payloads are usually solar panels, parabolic troughs, fresnel reflectors, lenses or the mirrors of a heliostat.

### Manual and Automatic modes

Manual mode: User can use IR remote to set the angle of motor, The change in angle will be displayed on the 16x2 lcd display. 

Automatic mode: Using photoresistor or LDR the motor is set to the best position so that solar panel can get optimum output.
